*************problem 4****************

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

*/

/*

possible solution would be to:

1. set variables for two numbers each '999' being the largest number in a three digit number.

2. a loop to multiply the two numbers and store the products in an array

3. compare the values by getting:

	a. get length
	b. is is even 9odd can not be a palindromic number)
	c. devide the value into two sections
	d. reverse one of them.
	e. compare for similarity
	f. if equal store the value in an array

4. output the array

Learn From Euler Project
========================

I found somewhere in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) a person asking for advice on becoming a better programmer, and the response was *"go solve [Euler project](http://projecteuler.net/) problems, they will help you think outside the box"*.  So here is my repo of my attempts at solving the problems in `php`.  Since Object Oriented PHP is also on the block for a learning exercise I decided to implement that as well and create classes for each of the problems to make them a little more interactive as far as reusing parts of the solution process.

###Progress so far
